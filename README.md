# INTRODDUCTION
welcome to this small python initiation project.

# What is the python-lesson-1 project?
The aim of this project is to write programs using the python programming language, and share the code - with a lot of comments and explanations - so that others can learn and contribute as well.

It would also be interesting to suggest learning pathways. But anyone should be free to learn and contribute in their own way, and at their own pace.
